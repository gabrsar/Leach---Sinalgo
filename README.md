# Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy on Sinalgo.

An implementation of LEACH algorithm using Sinalgo framework.

Developed as work of Computer Networks discipline activity, the course of Computer Science Bachelor in São Paulo State University (UNESP) campus of "São José do Rio Preto".

After the discipline tried to implement some new features and my time was short so not ready.

Forgive me for the mess, I was beginning to use git.

The project code is in src/projects/leach or 
https://github.com/gabrsar/Leach---Sinalgo/tree/master/src/projects/leach
